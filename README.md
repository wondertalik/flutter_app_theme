# Flutter-App-Theme

The idea of the application is to help understand the implementation of the [material design](https://material.io) in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). 

Inspired by session of Material Theming with Flutter [Flutter Interact '19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stoJpMeS5aY&t=1311s).
